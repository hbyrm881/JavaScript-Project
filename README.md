Todo App

This Todo app is a collaborative project built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and external CSS for styling. It allows users to add tasks with optional deadlines, display them dynamically, mark tasks as completed with a strikethrough effect, delete individual tasks, and clear the entire list. The app uses localStorage to persist tasks across sessions. The clean and responsive UI is designed with flexbox and styled with an external CSS file, demonstrating practical DOM manipulation, event handling, data persistence, and separation of concerns in front-end development.
